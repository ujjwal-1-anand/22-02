Hello, In the Ditto release job today 2 Dittos field with error "[de.hybris.platform.servicelayer.interceptor.impl.MandatoryAttributesValidator@7498c89e]:missing values for [kitEntryProduct] in model LynxKitEntryProductCartEntryModel (<unsaved>) to create a new LynxKitEntryProductCartEntry"
Bundle 116159V had a set-up issue with a child item that Janet fixed this morning. I reran the Ditto release job and received the same error. Is there anything we need to do (e.g. recalc) to fix the broken relationship????

Alec  10:08 PM
select {ce.order}, {ce.info} 
from {LynxKitEntryProductCartEntry! AS ce 
    }
where {ce.kitEntryProduct} is null

Hi @Alec, We have another 5 Dittos today with the missing key issue. My question is the key is missing on the template and carts. If we do the template will it propagate to the carts or do I need to manually do this for on both cart and template? (edited) 

Thom Riemersma  4:59 PM
@Alec -- Also I'm seeing item 113803 twice on the Ditto template. How do I know which is part of the Kit and which is standalone purchase? Assuming the one under the parent bundle item is the child?  For DItto F746DCC4-B724-43ED-A102-0A1318074EC6 (edited)
